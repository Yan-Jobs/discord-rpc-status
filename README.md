# discord-rpc-buttons
discord-rpc-buttons is a script that allow you to have a custom RPC (rich presence status) on your discord account.
# Starting
First go in [discord developers portal](https://discord.dev), and create a new app ⚠️ The name of your app will display on your discord status ⚠️.
Copy your application id and paste it at the last line of `index.js`. You can upload an image in the portal and type his name in the `large_image` field.
Finally you have to do: `node index.js` or use on Windows the `start.bat`, on linux `chmod +x start.sh` then `./start.sh` and on Mac remove `@echo off` and do the same step as linux.
