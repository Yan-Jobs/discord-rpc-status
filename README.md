# discord-rpc-buttons
discord-rpc-buttons is a script that allow you to have a custom RPC (rich presence status) on your discord account.
# Starting
You have just to do: `node index.js` or use on Windows the `start.bat`, on linux `chmod +x start.sh` then `./start.sh` and on Mac remove `@echo off` and do the same step as linux.
